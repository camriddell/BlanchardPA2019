    "\n",
    "The paper focuses on the fiscal and welfare costs of public debt when safe interest rates are low. It shows how both the average risky rate and the average safe rate determine welfare outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First, the paper looks at the effects of an intergenerational transfer in an overlapping generation model with uncertainty.** As in the Diamond model, a transfer has two effects on welfare: an effect through reduced capital accumulation, and an indirect effect, through the induced change in the returns to labor and capital. The welfare effect through lower capital accumulation depends on the safe rate. It is positive if, on average, the safe rate is less than the growth rate. The intuitive reason is that, in effect, the safe rate is the relevant risk-adjusted rate of return on capital, thus it is the rate that must be compared to the growth rate. The welfare effect through the induced change in returns to labor and capital depends instead on the average (risky) marginal product of capital. It is negative if, on average, the marginal product of capital exceeds the growth rate. **Thus, in the current situation where it indeed appears that the safe rate is less than the growth rate, but the average marginal product of capital exceeds the growth rate, the two effects have opposite signs, and the effect of the transfer on welfare is ambiguous.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second, the paper turns to debt and shows that a debt rollover differs in two ways from a transfer scheme.** First, with respect to feasibility: so long as the safe rate remains less than the growth rate, the ratio of debt to GDP decreases over time; a sequence of adverse shocks may however increase the safe rate sufficiently so as to lead to explosive dynamics, with higher debt increasing the safe rate, and the higher safe rate in turn increasing debt over time. Second, with respect to desirability: a successful debt rollover can yield positive welfare effects, but less so than the transfer scheme. The reason is that a debt\n",
    "rollover pays people a lower rate of return than the implicit rate in the transfer scheme.\n"

In a debt rollover, they receive a rate of return of only Rf, which is typically less than 1. At the margin, they are indifferent to holding debt or capital. There is still an inframarginal effect, a consumer surplus (taking the form of a less risky portfolio, and thus less risky second period consumption), but the positive effect on welfare is smaller than in the straight transfer scheme. The second effect, due to the change in wages and rate of return on capital, is still present, so the net effect on welfare, while less persistent as debt decreases over time, is more likely to be negative.\n",

For the generation receiving the initial transfer associated with debt issuance, the effect is clearly positive and large.

But the welfare gain is small (equal initially to about 0.18 percent and decreasing over time), compared to the initial welfare effect on the old from the initial transfer (8.75 percent).\n",
